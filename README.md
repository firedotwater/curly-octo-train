## About the mini project :writing_hand:

Hello folks! I'm Fabio, the one and only. In this repository I'll provide my project and explain what it does and how I went by step by step.

## Why did I this? :computer:

The idea is to buy a dummy domain, host a t2.micro instance on AWS, and install and configure major packages. [Here](packages.md) is a complete list of the packages.Â And be able to setup my own Unix mail server and login with a client to the mail account. I was looking anyway do to somithing like this for my own porposes. So I needed to write this ducomentation but now I'm force do to it beautiful.

## Progress :bulb:

As mentioned, [here](docs/doc.md) will be the whole step-by-step documentation of what happened and what I did to achieve the main goal. I decided to split every task to have a better view of what has changed on the t2.micro instance.


## Conclusion :low_brightness:

This entire project was very interesting because I could resolve a real need, and it works properly. I can create x mail addresses for the dummy domain, send and receive mail, and it will store it on the EC2 instance. The main configuration of the postfix aka mailserver, was very intense. Beside the mailserver configuration, I used certbot to enroll and let's encrypt certificates for the nginx webserver. 

[Here](testing/testing.md) I did some testing to check if everything worked as expected.
